Switch vimrc files without pain

Usage:
  swim add <URLToRaw or pathToFile>  <alias>   Add a swim alias
  swim with <alias>                            Change active vimrc file
  swim ls                                      List aliased vimrc files
  swim active                                  Show currently aliased vimrc
  swim rename <alias1> <alias2>                Rename alias (like Linux mv)
  swim delete <alias>                          Delete an alias entirely
  swim update                                  Download newest version
  swim version                                 Print version
  swim help                                    Show this message


Example:
  swim add github.com/dawsonbotsford/swim/exampleVimrcs/vimrcWikia.vim example
  swim ls                    Show available swim aliases
  swim with example          Set ~/.swim/.swimrc.example as primary .vimrc
  swim with main             Set ~/.swim/.swimrc.main as primary .vimrc


Setup:
  On install, you will have the \"main\" swim alias. Add alternate vimrc aliases with \"swim add <URLToRaw or pathToFile>  <alias>\"
  Then use \"swim with <alias\" to change your active vimrc file.
